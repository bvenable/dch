A web-based random character generator for the DC Heroes RPG (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Heroes)

Shamelessly ripped off from the MHR generator at http://marvel.raventower.com/

Basic instructions:

1. Install git
2. git clone https://github.com/bvenable/dch.git
3. Point web browser to \<path\>/dch/index.html
4. Set URL params to change limits

If you make code changes please point me to the fork and/or send pull requests. It's painfully basic right now, 
but the MHR generator gave me a great scaffolding and ideas to work from.
